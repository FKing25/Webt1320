                    <h2>History of Basketball</h2>
                    <p>The history of basketball began with its invention in 1891 in Springfield, Massachusetts by Canadian physical education instructor James Naismith. Naismith was asked to create a sport less physical than football while at the same time, creating something that would be entertaining to watch, and play. The game of basketball grew very rapidly, with college teams forming leagues within the first decade of the games invention. Basketball was introduced to the rest of the world due to efforts from the US Army and the YMCA. In 1893, the first international basketball match was organized. Members took the game to India, Japan, Persia, and China as well.

                        In 1895, the first recorded basketball game between two college teams was organized. The University of Minnesota A&M faced Hamline University under 9-on-9 rules, winning the game 9-3. In 1896, the first collegiate 5-on-5 game was played between Iowa and the University of Chicago, with Chicago winning 15-12. By 1900, most major colleges were fielding a basketball team. In 1905, formal collegiate rules were introduced for basketball and in 1909, the NCAA would take over the game for good. The first NCAA DI tournament would be held in 1939. ince 1900, 5-on-5 basketball has become the standard. Players used to be removed permanently from the game if they were substituted, by re-entry was allowed in 1921. Coaching was prohibited within the game until 1949.
